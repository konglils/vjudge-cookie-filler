# VJudge Cookie Filler

**VJudge Cookie Filler** is a Tampermonkey script that automatically retrieves cookies from supported online judges (OJs) so you can submit problems to Virtual Judge using your own accounts.

Currently supported OJs: Codeforces, QOJ, UVA, Luogu, and Nowcoder.  
It's easy to add support for more OJs — welcome to submit PR.

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension
2. In Tampermonkey settings, switch "Config mode" to **Advanced**
3. Make sure "Allow scripts to access cookies" is set to **All**
4. [Install the script](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/536701/VJudge%20Cookie%20Filler.user.js)
5. If you're using a Chromium-based browser, [enable developer mode](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q209)

## Usage

When you're on a submission page, simply click "My Account" or "Archive". The script will automatically perform — no manual steps needed.
